# 谁曾见过风

who has seen the wind ？ 

neither I nor you. 

but when the leaves hang trembling， 

the wind is passing through. 

who has seen the wind？ 

neither you nor I. 

but when the trees bow down their heads， 

the wind is passing by. 

谁曾见过风？ 

你我皆不曾。 

但看木叶舞枝头， 

便晓风穿过。 

谁曾见过风？ 

你我皆不曾。 

但看万木垂梢首， 

便晓风吹过。
