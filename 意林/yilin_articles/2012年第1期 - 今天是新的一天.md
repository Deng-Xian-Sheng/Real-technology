# 今天是新的一天

你的明天充满阳光， 

如你心中所想。 

你没有理由， 

把昨天的黑暗， 

带到今天。 

今天是美妙的全新体验， 

有那么多种可能， 

使你的生活如你所愿。 

今天开始有新的幸福， 

新的方向和新的伙伴。 

今天你要提醒自己， 

你有足够的能力和力量， 

把满意、爱情和欢乐带进你的生活。 

今天你要了解自己， 

给自己足够的爱心和耐心。 

今天你会勇往直前， 

奔向那灿烂的明天。 

Your tomorrows are as bright 

as you want to make them. 

There is no reason to carry 

the darkness of the past 

with you into today. 

Today is a wonderful new experience， 

full of every possibility to make 

your life exactly what you want it to be. 

Today is the beginning of new happiness, 

new directions and new relationships. 

Today is the day to remind yourself 

that you possess the power 

and strength you need 

to bring contentment, love and joy into your life. 

Today is the day to understand yourself 

and to give yourself the love 

and the patience that you need. 

Today is the day to move forward 

towards your bright tomorrow.
