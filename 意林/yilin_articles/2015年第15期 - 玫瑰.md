# 玫瑰

没给予，怎会收获？ 

惧死的心，永远无法学会活。 

夜已太孤独，路已太漫长。 

你却以为，爱只眷顾幸运儿与强者。 

铭记吧，雪后的冬日里， 

深藏一颗种子，太阳照了，春天到了，就成玫瑰。 

It’s the one who won’t be taken，who cannot seem to give. 

And the soul， afraid of dyin’， that never learns to live. 

When the night has been too lonely， and the road has been too long， 

And you think that love is only for the lucky and the strong， 

Just remember in the winter far beneath the bitter snows， 

Lies the seed， that with the sun’s love， in the spring becomes The Rose.
