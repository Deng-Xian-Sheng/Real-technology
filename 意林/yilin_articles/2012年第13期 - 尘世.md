# 尘世

男人对于这个世界的兴趣，无非是来自对自己的兴趣。小时候，器小未盈，故只关心一己之事。长大了以后，器大满盈，或为政客、哲学家或冒险家。老了的时候，器内枯竭，再也无法泛滥，于是返老还童。

The World

A man's interest in the world is only the overflow from his interest in himself. When you are a child your vessel is not yet full；so you care for nothing but your own affairs.When you grow up，your vessel overflows；and you are a politician, a philosopher or an explorer and adventurer．In old age the vessel dries up：there is no overflow，you are a child again．
